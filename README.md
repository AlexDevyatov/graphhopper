# GraphHopper Navigation Web Service

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation)

This repository converts routes that are calculated with GraphHopper in a JSON that is consumable with the [Navigation SDK](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-android) and provides the server side part of a navigation application.

An example Android app is provided in [this repository](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example).
